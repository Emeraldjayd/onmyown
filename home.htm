     	  <h1>Find out the benefits of &quot;Outsourcing&quot; with<br>
   	      ADVANTAGE EMPLOYER SOLUTIONS</h1>
     	  <p>&quot;Outsourcing&quot; is a good thing in today's fast-paced business world, you don't have time to build your business and keep up-to-date with the ever-changing rules and regulations governing employment practices, along with the myriad of other paperwork required of a business. That's why outsourcing has become the most efficient and cost effective way to operate a business. <br>
   	    </p>
     	  <p>Why Outsource Human Resources?<br>
     	    Nearly all business owners would rather focus their time and energy on revenue-generating activities than employee administrative duties. However, most employers don't have the necessary human resources training, payroll and accounting skills, knowledge of regulatory compliances, risk management background, or employee benefit programs to meet the &quot;high standards&quot; equated with a good employer. </p>
     	  <p>How does a PEO arrangement work?<br>
     	    There exists a co-employment relationship between a PEO, a worksite employee, and a client company, in which both the PEO and client company share responsibilities. The client company retains control of the worksite activities and the PEO assumes the responsibility and liability for the employee administration. </p>
     	  <p>Why would a business use a PEO?<br>
     	    All business owners want to focus their time and energy on the &quot;business of their business&quot; and not the &quot;business of employment.&quot; </p>
